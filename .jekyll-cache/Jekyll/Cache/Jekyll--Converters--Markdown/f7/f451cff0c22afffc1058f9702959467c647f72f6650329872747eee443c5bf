I"#	<p>The exact scope and details of every microlearning development project is unique in terms of the exact scope and details. However, there are certain similarities between most projects. Here are some details about “typical” microlearning projects.</p>

<h2 id="project-duration">Project duration</h2>

<p>Project duration can vary drastically based on module type, volume, and customer needs. A ballpark estimate for a “typical” project is between eight and 16 weeks. Your involvement will vary depending on the project’s type and size and your specific role. Contact your Project Manager (PjM) for more information.</p>

<p>Projects start when contracts are signed between Waypoint and its customer. We consider them finished after our detailed reviews and testing processes confirm that content is fully qualified for publishing. A project’s development phase, where content is designed and created, typically starts around the fourth week of a project schedule and lasts between four and six weeks.</p>

<h2 id="project-phases">Project phases</h2>

<p>Most projects have six phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Engagement</li>
  <li>Initiation</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>Publication</li>
  <li>Project closeout</li>
</ol>

<p>These materials cover phases 3, 4, and 5.</p>

<h1 id="overview-of-the-microlearning-module-creation-process">Overview of the microlearning module-creation process</h1>

<p>This guide focuses on three phases in creating microlearning modules. It covers phase 3 (Design) through phase 5 (Publication).</p>
