<h3 id="sme-tasks">SME Tasks</h3>

<p>As a SME, you are expected to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Familiarize yourself and follow the schedule provided by your Project Manager (PjM).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Don’t underestimate the time needed to develop content. Content development can be time-consuming, especially when you are also developing exercises.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are many people working together on a project, and when one person is late, it can affect many other processes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you think you won’t meet a deadline, tell your PjM right away.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be available to the team for the duration of the project.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You’re expected to reply to emails, questions, Teams chats and the like by the next working day at the latest.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>During a project, even if you think you’re not directly involved in the current process, be available for questions and clarifications. This means using the tools that Waypoint uses (Teams and Outlook) and having them “on.”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You might find it useful to install these apps on your phone so you can monitor messages and email.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If anticipate any absences, tell the PjM as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use and understand Microsoft and Waypoint references that define the content requirements you need to use.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Microlearning modules, for example, have structural and content requirements largely defined in the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/learn/?branch=main">Microsoft Learn contributor guide.</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use and understand Microsoft and Waypoint references that define the writing style you need to use.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There are particular ways to write content that reflect expectations from Microsoft. If you don’t write in that style, the people who edit your document (Instructional Designers, Microlearning Specialists, and Copy Editors) will change it. This can extend development time because you might need to review changes that might inadvertently alter the text’s meaning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the provided Word template and Waypoint/Microsoft form factor appropriate for the module to create the module Design (Word) document.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure your knowledge of Word styles is adequate. The Word Heading and other styles in the templates must be used to get a good result at the end of development when the files are moved into GitHub.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the provided Word template to write the module content:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Use the form factor and requirements appropriate for the module. Refer to our Develop Microlearning modules page, the <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/learn/?branch=main">Microsoft Learn Contributors Guide,</a> and the links included in the template itself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Write with the Microsoft Style. Refer to the <a href="https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&amp;topicid=29021">Microsoft Writing Style Guide</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do not copy/paste or reuse content directly from other sources. This includes content on  https://docs.microsoft.com.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: While we often receive re-use permissions that is NEVER permission to copy and paste. That is plagiarism, and our customers can cancel contracts if we fail their scans for plagiarized content. Consider content from https://docs.microsoft.com, Azure Marketplace, etc. eligible for re-use, but always put copy into your own words and graphics updated for Learn standards.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write a <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/learn/id-guidance-scenarios?branch=main">module scenario</a> to include in the Introduction unit, and a resolution of the scenario to include in the Summary unit. Use the scenario throughout the module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write knowledge check questions that reflect the “takeaway” learning from the module. The questions must follow the guidance in <a href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/learn/unit-add-a-knowledge-check?branch=main">Add a knowledge check to a unit</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write exercises for the module using the appropriate environment. For example, bring your own subscription (BYOS) or a Microsoft-provided Azure sandbox.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure that the environment you are using for exercise development is the same (or almost the same) as the environment that students will use to perform the exercise(s). In the case of BYOS, this includes creating a document based on Microsoft Marketplace with instructions to what services are required for the exercise.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Work with Waypoint’s functional Test team to ensure all exercises meet the expected outcomes.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take screenshots or request graphics/videos:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Take relevant screenshots of the user interface when appropriate, following the guidance for graphics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Limit the number of screenshots you use because they can date the material. Be sure and blur or remove any personal identifying information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide sketches or example graphics to the Multimedia Provider (MP) so they can create diagrams, flowcharts, or other illustrations to help explain conceptual material.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a 300-words-or-less “directorial guidance” document to Microsoft to obtain a demonstration video. They create desktop demonstration videos that have captions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Request graphics or videos as soon as possible in the development cycle to allow time for graphic creation and refinement. Videos have been known to take 6-8 weeks to deliver.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be available for review cycles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Participate in review cycles by being available to reviewers for clarifications such as edits, terminology checks, and clarification of exercise steps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should respond to emails and the like no later than one business day.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
