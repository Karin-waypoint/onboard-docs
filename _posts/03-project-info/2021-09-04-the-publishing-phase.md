## Publishing

Once all units of a module have an Acrolinx score of 80 or higher and pass all build-validation tests, the MLS hands off the module to the PjM, who then submits it to Microsoft for their publishing process:

1. The PjM adds “#sign-off” to the comments in the pull request.
2. The pull request gets assigned to the appropriate Microsoft reviewer.

3. The Microsoft Reviewer responds with feedback in comments.

4. The PjM resolves the issues raised in the Microsoft reviewer’s comments.
5. The PjM comments and adds “#sign-off” in comments in the pull request.
