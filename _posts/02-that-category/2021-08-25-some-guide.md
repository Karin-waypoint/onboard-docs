To do.

Here's an example of an embedded video.
<!-- to add a video into a page
change the value of video_url:
from "none" to "https://your-video-url.com/example"
then add the following code in your markdown file
wherever you want the video to appear -->
{% include video.html %}

<!-- place the code below at the end of each markdown file for previous/ next page links -->
{% include paginator.html %}
