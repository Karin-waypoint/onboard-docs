Welcome to Waypoint Ventures! We’re glad you’ve joined our team to help produce microlearning content.

We’ve found that people who fill Subject-Matter Expert (SME) Writer and Microlearning Specialist (MLS) roles typically have a smoother experience developing content if they understand their [role on the development team]({{site.baseurl}}/people/who-is-who.html), including what we expect of them (and what we don’t), and who else might be on their team. We think you’ll find these materials helpful as you dig into Waypoint’s development process and your critical role in it.

Use the vertical menu on these pages to explore all the materials. Here are a few recommended places to start:

- Read about [communication, credentials, and information management]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/communication.html). 
- Get an [introduction to microlearning projects]({{site.baseurl}}/project-info/introduction-to-microlearning-projects.html).
- Learn what [content development tools]({{site.baseurl}}/get-started/content-development-tools.html) you'll need.
- Read ["Who's who on the team"]({{site.baseurl}}/people/who-is-who.html) to learn about your roles and responsibilities, and those of your teammates.
- Get an overview of the tasks and responsibilities of [SME Writers]({{site.baseurl}}/people/sme-writer.html).
- Get an overview of the tasks and responsibilities of [Microlearning Specialists (MLS)]({{site.baseurl}}/people/mls.html).
